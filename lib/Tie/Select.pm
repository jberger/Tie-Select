=head1 NAME

Tie::Select - Provides a localized interface to the C<select> function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict; use warnings;
 use Tie::Select;

 {
   local $SELECT = *STDERR;
   print "This goes to STDERR";
 }

 print "This goes to STDOUT";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl builtin C<print>, when not called with an explicit file handle, will print to the file handle designated by the C<select> command. This is a global action, which is bad. Further, it has an awkward interface for restoring a previous handle; on a call to C<select> a reference to the old handle is returned, which has to itself be C<select>-ed to restore the old handle. Better to see an example.

 my $stdin = select *STDERR;
 print "To STDERR";
 select $stdin;

L<Tie::Select> offers a localizable interface to C<select>. Simply assign a handle to the C<$SELECT> variable provided by this module to change the C<select>-ed handle. If this is done with C<local> the change is dynamically bound to the enclosing scope. Therefore the above example becomes simply:

 {
   local $SELECT = *STDERR;
   print "This goes to STDERR";
 }

The inspiration for this type of interface is L<File::chdir> which provides a similar localizable interface to the current working directory.
